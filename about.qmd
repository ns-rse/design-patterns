This is a blog about [software design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_Patterns) and is a method
for me to develop my understanding of how they work.

I have written the [python-design-patterns](https://github.com/ns-rse/python-design-patterns) package to implement each
of the factory methods I have documented here with simple [pytest](https://pytest.org).
