The singleton pattern ensures there is only one instance of a class and at the same time it provides a global access
point to that instance.

![[_Another type of Singelton._ Picture by me.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/slackline/4949025595/)](https://live.staticflickr.com/4126/4949025595_b772c9e608_k.jpg)

**Singletons violate the _Single Responsibility Principle_** and their use is considered poor
practice. Further having global variables/objects that can be accessed from anywhere isn't particularly safe as content
can be over-written at any point leading to problems. Regardless I'm on a mission to learn!

Why would you use a Singleton pattern if it violates the _Single Responsibility Principle_ and is potentially unsafe?
Well it is commonly used when a centralised point of access is require to say a database or a configuration manager.

# Implementation

Implementing singletons in Python is pretty straight-forward courtesy of the `__new__` method. However, because of the
hazard of only having a single instance of the class you need to be mindful when using threads (multiple processes) so
that there is no conflict. This is achieved using the `Lock` and `Thread` classes from the
[`threading`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html) library.

``` {.python}
from threading import Lock, Thread

class Singleton:
    _instance = {}

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if not cls._instance:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls, *args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instance

def main():
    s1 = Singleton()
    s2 = Singleton()

    print(s1 is s2)  # True

```


# Practical Example

Beyond demonstrating that a second instance of the `Singleton` class isn't instantiated to the `s2` object that is a
fairly useless example. A more practical example might be when you wish to have a connection to a database but only
wish to have a single connection and not to create lots of new connections every time you wish to interact with the
database.

``` {.python}
from threading import Lock, Thread

import sqlite3


```
